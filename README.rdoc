= slurper gem

Slurper allows you to quickly compose your stories in a text file and import them into Pivotal Tracker.

Works great with slurper.vim! (http://github.com/adamlowe/vim-slurper)

== Install

  $gem install slurper

== Config

Slurper requires a slurper_config.yml file in your working directory. This file contains your Tracker API and story requestor information.

=== Example

  project_id: 1234
  token: 123abc123abc123abc
  requested_by: Jane Stakeholder

The project_id tells tracker which project to add your stories to. It can be found on the project settings or the url for the project.

The token can be found on your personal profile page in Pivotal Tracker.

The requested_by field should be the name of your project stakeholder exactly as it appears in tracker.

== Usage

Create a stories.slurper file and compose your stories in the slurper story format. In your working directory use the slurp command to import your stories from the stories.slurper file into Pivotal Tracker. Slurper looks for a stories.slurper file in your current directory by default, however, you can provide an alternate story source file if necessary.

Default

  $slurp ~/stories.slurper

Also valid

  $slurp ~/special_stories.slurper

Or even

  $slurp ~/mystories.txt

=== Example stories.slurper

  ==
  story_type:
    chore
  name:
    Set Up Staging Environment
  description:
    Set up and configure staging environment for approval of stories

  labels:
    staging

  story_type:
    feature
  name:
    Campaign Manager Does Something
  description:
    In order to get some value
    As a campaign manager
    I want to do something

    - can do something

  labels:
    campaign managers
  ==
  story_type:
    release
  name:
    Big Release
  description:

  labels:

  ==
  story_type:
    bug
  name:
    I did something and nothing happened
  description:
    When I do something, another thing is supposed to happen but I see an error screen instead.

  labels:
    campaign managers

Note: the story source file is whitespace-sensitive. Be sure the value for each key phrase is indented with two spaces beneath each key phrase. Also, start each story with a double-equals on its own line.

Your best bet is to leverage slurper.vim and benefit from its auto-indenting goodness.

=== Example advanced_stories.slurper

There are some advanced techniques for formatting your stories beyond the simple type, name, description and label fields. See below for some examples.

  ==
  story_type:
    feature
  name:
    Make the cart accept coupons on checkout
  description:
    When I get to the checkout phase, I want the ability to add an optional coupon code. Use TESTCOUPON to test with.
  labels:
    cart,coupon system,checkout
  estimate:
    3
  requested_by:
    Joe Developer

Note: Any field that is supported by the Pivotal Tracker API should work within reason (i.e file uploads won't work). To get an idea of the fields available see this page (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/csv_import_export/#example-csv-data)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request.
